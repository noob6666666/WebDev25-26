    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <pr>HTML is the standard markup language used to structure and format content on the World Wide Web. Using a series of tags and elements, it defines the building blocks of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and links. Web browsers interpret the HTML file to render the content into the visual and interactive web pages that users see.</pr>
    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <pr>CSS is a language used to describe the presentation and styling of a web page. It allows developers to control the fonts, colors, layout, and visual aesthetics of a website. By separating presentation from content, CSS makes web development and updates more efficient, as styles can be consistently applied across many pages.</pr>
    <!-- Challenge 6a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <pr>JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages interactive and dynamic. Unlike static HTML and CSS, it allows for user engagement, such as dynamically changing content, animations, and interactive maps. It runs primarily in a user's web browser, but a runtime environment like Node.js also allows it to be used for server-side development.</pr>
    <!-- Challenge 8a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
     <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
     <pr>Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites quickly. It provides a collection of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as navigation bars, modals, and forms, that can be easily customized. Bootstrap simplifies front-end development by ensuring consistency across different screen sizes and devices.</pr>
